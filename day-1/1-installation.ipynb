    "\n",
    "> LilyPond is a music engraving program, devoted to producing the highest-quality sheet music possible. It brings the aesthetics of traditionally engraved music to computer printouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "> LilyPond is a compiled system: it is run on a text file describing the music. The resulting output is viewed on-screen or printed. In some ways, LilyPond is more similar to a programming language than graphical score editing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ...\n",
    "\n",
    "> You do not write music by dragging notes from a graphical toolbar and placing them on a dynamically refreshing score; you write music by typing text. This text is interpreted (or “compiled”) by LilyPond, which produces beautifully engraved sheet music.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does Abjad use it for?\n",
    "\n",
    "LilyPond is Abjad's musical typesetting engine. Abjad generates LilyPond input files (`.ly`) and then runs LilyPond against those files, creating PDFs.\n",

    "Always, always install LilyPond from LilyPond's website: http://lilypond.org.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.[24][25] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[26][27] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.[28]\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[29]\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,[30] Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, so Python-based software can be distributed to, and used on, those environments with no need to install a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do I install it?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're on OSX or a \\*nix system like Debian, Arch, Ubuntu etc. then you almost certainly have some version of Python installed. Abjad works with both Python 2.7 and 3.3+, but for the sake of modernity, let's try to work in Python 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On \\*nix, use your package manager (`apt`, `yum`) to get the newest Python version.\n",

It's used extensively by many different people and organizations all over the world (scientific computing, financial computing, systems operations) which in turn means that it has a huge ecosystem of libraries we can tap into, and tens of thousands of programmers and users looking into its every aspect. And because Python is _interpreted_ and not _compiled_, the cycle of development - writing code, trying it out, revising - is fast.\n",
